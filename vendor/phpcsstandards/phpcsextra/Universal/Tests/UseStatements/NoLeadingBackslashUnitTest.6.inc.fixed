 * The behaviour of the sniff for this code sample will be different depending on the PHPCS version.
 * On PHPCS < 4.0, these will correctly be flagged for "no space" after the `function`/`const` keyword.
 * On PHPCS 4.0, this will no longer be flagged as keywords are allowed in namespaced names,
 * so the `function`/`const` is tokenized as part of the namespaced name and won't be flagged.
