== Development ==

This plugin uses Laravel Mix (a wrapper around Webpack) to compile and bundle JavaScript and CSS files for production.

= Source Code =

The original source code for all compiled JavaScript and CSS files can be found at:
[https://github.com/miketropi/giftflow](https://github.com/miketropi/giftflow)

= File Structure =

In the `assets/js/` directory, the plugin follows this naming convention:

* `*.js` - Original, uncompiled source files (human-readable)
* `*.bundle.js` - Compiled/minified production files (generated by build process)

For example:

* `forms.js` → Source file
* `forms.bundle.js` → Compiled production file

The same pattern applies to all JavaScript files:

* `common.js` / `common.bundle.js`
* `stripe-donation.js` / `stripe-donation.bundle.js`
* `paypal-donation.js` / `paypal-donation.bundle.js`
* `grecaptcha.js` / `grecaptcha.bundle.js`

Only the `*.bundle.js` files are enqueued in production. The source `*.js` files are included in the repository for transparency and to comply with WordPress.org guidelines requiring human-readable source code.

= Build Commands =

To rebuild assets locally:

`npm install` - Install dependencies
`npm run dev` - Watch for changes and rebuild automatically during development
`npm run build` - Build for production (minified)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
